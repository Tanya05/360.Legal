Masa Vukotic was a 17-year-old girl whose life was taken in a violent and frenzied stabbing attack by a stranger as she walked through a Melbourne park. Sean Christian Price, 31, stabbed Masa 49 times, then went on a two-day rampage that finished with the rape of another woman.

Her murder in March sparked community outrage.

Price told police he just had to kill her because he thought she was behaving like Snow White when she talked to a bird in the park.

Price, who has pleaded guilty to killing the schoolgirl, had a lengthy criminal history of rape, stalking, assault, indecent assault and making threats to kill spanning more than a decade.
