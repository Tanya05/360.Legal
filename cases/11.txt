Accused Child Killer Goes Free

People were outraged when a jury in Orlando, Fla., acquitted Casey Anthony on July 5 of murdering her 2-year-old daughter Caylee. On the first day of the trial, Anthony's lawyer Jose Baez dropped her longstanding claim that Caylee had been kidnapped by a fictitious babysitter nicknamed Zanny the Nanny and had instead drowned in the family pool. Baez claimed that Anthony's father had sexually abused her for years, trained her to lie and helped Anthony dispose of Caylee's body.

Emotions were so raw after the verdict that the court decided to keep the names of the jurors secret to protect them from death threats.

Casey Anthony, 25, is on probation for lying to police about Zanny the Nanny, but her location has also been kept secret by the court because of death threats.
