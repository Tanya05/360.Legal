On 7.11.1990 a complaint was filed against the petitioner and others under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as the 'NDPS Act, 1985'). Before any warrant of arrest could be served on the petitioner in respect of the aforesaid case lodged under the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, the petitioner was arrested on 21.11.1990 in the case registered under the Arms Act and the Motor Vehicles Act. He was arrested and detained in District Jail Ghazipur. The petitioner moved an application for bail on 3.12.1990 before the Session Judge in respect of the case under Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The detention order under Section 3(1) of the PITNDPS Act, 1988 was passed by the Joint Secretary to the Government of India on 4.12.1990 and the aforesaid detention order was served along with the grounds of detention on 10.12.1990 while the petitioner was in the custody at District Jail Ghazipur. The petitioner made a representation to the President of India and Joint Secretary to the Government of India on 22.12.1990. The Central Government rejected the representation on 25.1.1991. The petitioner then filed a habeas corpus petition in the Allahabad High Court challenging his detention. There was a difference of opinion between the two Learned Judge of the High Court in the order pronounced on the habeas corpus petition on 23.4.1991. The matter was ultimately heard by the Full Bench of the High Court and the Writ Petition was dismissed by unanimous order dated 21.2.1992. The petitioner aggrieved against the order of the High Court has come before this Court by filing special leave petition under Article 136 of the Constitution.

7. It was submitted that the above facts mentioned in para 21 clearly show the unawareness of the correct facts on the part of the detaining authority and which leads to the non-application of mind of the detaining authority. It was pointed out that though the complaint under the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 had already been filed on 7.11.1990 yet the detaining authority under the above para No. 21 of the grounds of detention dated 4.12.1990 was mentioning "that prosecution proceedings under Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 are likely to be initiated against you." It was further submitted that though a warrant of arrest had also been issued by the Court at Varanasi where the case under Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 had already been initiated and a bill application had also been moved still the detaining authority was mentioning that the prosecution proceedings under Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 were likely to be initiated against the petitioner. It was also argued in this regard that when the petitioner was already in custody and a case had been initiated against him under the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, there was no question of any grant of bail and there was no ground or justification for the satisfaction of the detaining authority and to hold that there was any compelling necessity for the detention of the petitioner under the provisions of Section 3(1) of the PITNDPS Act, 1988. It was also argued that the grounds of detention did not show that the detaining authority was aware that the petitioner was already in jail in District Jail, Gazipur for the offences under the Arms Act and the Motor Vehicles Act.
