Seattle Woman Released After Four Years in Italian Prison

Amanda Knox, 24, nearly collapsed Oct. 3 when an Italian appeals court ruled that her murder conviction four years earlier was based on faulty evidence and freed her. It ended years of legal setbacks that had convinced a jury in Perugia that she and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito joined in the grisly stabbing and sexual assault of her British roommate Meredith Kercher. The sex-tinged murder story spawned several books and a TV movie.

In dismissing the charges, the court wrote that the theory that Knox and Sollecito decided to kill Kercher "was not, in fact probable: the sudden choice of two young people, good and open to other people, to do evil for evil's sake, just like that, without another reason."

Now home in Seattle, Knox tries to keep a low profile although she continues to be followed by paparazzi.
