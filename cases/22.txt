Three men were out fishing on November 5 when they found the body of 12-year-old schoolgirl Tiahleigh Palmer resting on the banks of the Pimpama River on the Gold Coast.

She’d vanished six days earlier after being dropped off at her Marsden school by her foster carer.

With so many weeks having passed, police are increasingly desperate for clues in the suspected murder, particularly the whereabouts of her school uniform and distinctive backpack.

The river continues to be a focal point in the hunt for evidence, with a girl’s shoe found there earlier this month.
