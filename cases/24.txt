Allan Keith Huggins was found guilty in February of sexually abusing seven children when he was an education officer at the Warminda school-to-work program for troubled boys and a private counsellor in 1990 and 1991.

When the 68-year-old was sentenced in September to nine years and three months behind bars, he shouted that it was a miscarriage of justice.

In a separate case, a former pastor and father of two, who raped a girl as she lay naked and blindfolded on a bed, was jailed in November for 10-and-a-half years.

The girlâ€™s father, who is also accused of abusing her, offered her up to the pastor and allegedly to six other men when she was aged between 11 and 13.
