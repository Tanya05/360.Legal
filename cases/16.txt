rench Presidential Contender Beats Rape Rap

It was an international furor when Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund and a candidate to be president of France, was arrested in May and charged with raping New York hotel maid Nofissatou Diallo.

Five months later the charges were dropped because Diallo's credibility was impaired by changes in her story and comments she made about the case to a jailed friend.

After returning to France, Strauss-Kahn admitted having sex with Diallo, but said it was consensual.
