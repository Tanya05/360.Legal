Young mother Tara Brown was trapped in the wreck of her upturned car on the Gold Coast, when her former partner and ex-Bandido bikie Lionel Patea allegedly bludgeoned her to death with a fire hydrant. The crime horrified the nation, and sparked renewed efforts at the federal and state levels to do more to tackle domestic violence, and help women and children whose lives are in danger. Patea has been committed to stand trial for allegedly chasing down Ms Brown, forcing her off the road and then murdering her. Shortly after Ms Brown was attacked, Steven Lock allegedly shot dead his former partner dead in front of horrified diners at a McDonald’s store on the Gold Coast.

It later emerged that Lock, who also took his own life, had been subject to a domestic violence order. Karina Lock’s death further galvanised momentum for more effective action against domestic violence.
