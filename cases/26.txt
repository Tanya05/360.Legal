Drug prosecutions are unfortunately not uncommon in Australia. However, R v Paul McCauley; R v Christopher Johnston highlights a growing trend amongst criminal lawyers: ineptitude as a defence.
 
In 2014, McCauley and Johnston were charged with importing nearly 50 grams of cocaine, which they had attempted to mail to McCauley’s grandmother’s house. With the evidence beyond dispute, McCauley and Johnston’s lawyers sought to challenge the definition of “marketable quantity” by arguing the defendants had imported the cocaine for personal use.
 
Johnston’s lawyer, Steve Whybrow, told the jury: “These coke heads found a new way to get coke. You saw [Johnston] in the witness box – he was a terrible coke addict.”
 
McCauley’s lawyer James Lawton took a similar approach.
 
“These two are pretty much amateurs at importing cocaine,” he told the court.
 
“What they did is snort everything they had.”
 
The matter has yet to be resolved in court, but should the pair beat the charges, they will have some explaining to do to their employers.
