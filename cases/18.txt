Second Death Sentence for Petit Murders

The nightmare that Dr. William Petit has had to repeatedly relive since his wife and two daughters were killed in a 2007 home invasion finally ended on Dec. 9 when a judge sentenced Joshua Komisarjevsky, 31, to be executed. Komisarjevsky's accomplice Steven Hayes was sentenced to death last year.

Petit, the lone survivor of the assault, sat through every day of testimony in both Connecticut trials, hearing how his wife was raped and strangled, his youngest daughter sexually assaulted, and both daughters left tied to beds as the house was set on fire.

"We think justice has been served," Petit said at the conclusion of the case.
