Michael Jackson's Doctor Convicted of Manslaughter

A Los Angeles judge ripped into Dr. Conrad Murray for his treatment of the superstar Michael Jackson, calling the use of the powerful sedative propofol as a sleep aid "medicine madness." The judge said Murray was motivated by greed and a desire for fame. 

 The trial revealed much of Michael Jackson's eccentric lifestyle, but caused a sensation when the prosecutor introduced photos of Jackson's lifeless body on a hospital gurney.

Although Judge Michael Pastor sentenced Murray to four years in prison for involuntary manslaughter, Murray is expected to serve less than half of that because of prison overcrowding.
