Ex-Coach Jerry Sandusky Accused of Sexually Assaulting Boys

The sex abuse scandal at Penn State stunned the campus, but that shock turned to anger when the university's board ousted longtime football coach Joe Paterno.

Paterno and the school's president were booted when a grand jury report claimed that ex-assistant coach Jerry Sandusky had raped or sexually assaulted eight boys over a 15-year period, and numerous warnings were ignored by the school.

Sandusky has denied the accusations, but since the grand jury report was issued in November, two more young men have come forward to claim that they too were molested by Sandusky.
