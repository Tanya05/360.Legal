Rebecca Zahau's Bizarre Death Was Ruled a Suicide

Rebecca Zahau's body was found nude, hanging from a balcony with her hands and feet bound. A strange message was left in black paint on a wall. And her death last July, in an historic California mansion, came two days after her boyfriend's son suffered a fatal fall in the mansion while she was caring for the boy.

Zahau's family have not accepted the coroner's suicide conclusion and is trying to have the case reopened. The family's lawyer, Anne Bremner, had the body exhumed and the results revealed on the Dr. Phil show. During the show, noted medical examiner Dr. Cyril Wecht expressed "grave and serious doubts" that the woman killed herself.
