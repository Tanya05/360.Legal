For two long weeks in August, friends, family, police and total strangers scoured Queenslandâ€™s Lockyer Valley, searching for any sign of 16-year-old schoolgirl Jayde Kendall.

Missing posters featuring her young face were put up in every shop front in the rural valley, west of Brisbane.

But two weeks after she was last seen outside her high school, climbing into the car of her friend Brenden Jacob Bennetts, her body was found dumped in a paddock 17km away.

Bennetts has been charged with her murder, and interfering with her corpse.
