This case saw religion and court protocol clash in a manner that some NSW lawyers have described as an Australia-first.
 
Moutia Elzahed, wife of convicted Islamic State recruiter Hamdi Alqudsi, unsuccessfully sued both the Federal and NSW Police for assault, false imprisonment, claiming she was punched by police during a terror raid on her Revesby home in September 2014.
 
However, when asked to testify in her own case, she refused to remove her niqab – a full-face veil – once she took the stand. Her lawyer Clive Evatt cited religious reasons, telling NSW District Court Judge Audrey Balla that Elzahed could not expose he face to any male outside her family. Judge Balla offered to close the court during Elzahed’s testimony, or allow her to provide evidence via video link, however Elzahed refused on the basis of the mostly male legal counsels who would see her face.
 
With both options rejected, Judge Balla did not allow Elzahed to take the stand while she wore her veil.
 
The trial also drew controversy when Elzahed refused to stand for Judge Balla on her entry to the court. Evatt explained that, under strict Muslim law, Elzahed is not allowed to stand for anyone other than Allah. In response, NSW Attorney-General Gabrielle Upton has pushed for Elzahed to be the first person charged under the newly minted Courts Legislation Amendment (Disrespectful Behaviour) Bill 2016, which was passed by NSW Parliament in September last year.
 
Should Elzahed be charged, she could receive a $1,100 fine or up to 14 days in jail.
