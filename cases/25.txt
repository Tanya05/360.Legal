Bail Application for Aggravated Burglary and Other Charges

This is a case study on bail application for Aggravated Burglary and other charges.

Our client had been charged with Aggravated Burglary, False Imprisonment, and two counts of Kidnapping. The charges covered three alleged incidents.

In the first incident, it was alleged that the client had entered the complainant’s house without permission, assaulted the occupant, tied him up with gaffer tape, and put his head in a pillow case, before stealing items from the complainant’s house. There was a CCTV footage of the incident and the client had admitted to the incident in his interview with the police stating that he had ‘no regrets’ about it.

The second and third incidents related to two alleged kidnappings. In the third incident, the client had allegedly punched the complainant unconscious, loaded the complainant into a car, and then driven the complainant to a house where he and the co-accused made demands and assaulted him over a number of hours. The client and the co-accused were allegedly in possession of a handgun and spears during the kidnapping.

Following the incidents the police had conducted a search at the client’s address and a number of stolen items were recovered as well as a loaded shotgun. The prosecution case in relation to incidents two and three was strong, with there being CCTV and a number of witness statements in relation to the incidents.

We applied for bail and Rowan Slattery acted on the client’s behalf at the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court. The charges involved were:

    Aggravated Burglary
    Burglary
    Intentionally Cause Injury
    Recklessly Cause Injury
    Assault
    Theft
    Robbery

The police informant was cross-examined. Evidence was called from the client’s sister and mother, and a surety was organised.

Following submissions, the bail application for Aggravated Burglary and all other charges were granted.
